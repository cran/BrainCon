Description: A statistical tool to inference the multi-level partial correlations based on multi-subject time series data, especially for brain functional connectivity. It combines both individual and population level inference by using  the methods of Qiu and Zhou. (2021)<DOI: 10.1080/01621459.2021.1917417> and Genovese and Wasserman. (2006)<DOI: 10.1198/016214506000000339>. It realizes two reliable estimation methods of partial correlation coefficients, using scaled lasso and lasso. It can be used to estimate individual- or population-level partial correlations, identify nonzero ones, and find out unequal partial correlation coefficients between two populations.
